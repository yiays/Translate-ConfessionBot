# Translate Confessionbot
Thank you for showing interest in translating ConfessionBot to other languages!

## Getting started
ConfessionBot uses the `ini` files in this repo to speak in any language, to translate to a new language, you simply create a new file named after your language code and dialect code (eg. en-UK,de-DE,es-MX), fill it with the contents of the [en.ini](en.ini) file, and translate it from there. Instructions are included in the en.ini file. When you are done for the day, submit a pull request.

## Need help?
Contact Yiays#5930 on Discord if you need help. You can also complete the translation over chat instead of through GitHub if you would prefer.
